</li>
      <li><strong>
         1902 </strong>- Albert Einstein got a job in the patent office. He used his understanding of math and science in his new position, and it made him happy.
</li>
      <li><strong>
         1905 </strong>- Einstein submitted his first paper on his theory of thermodynamics. It was the first of many.
</li>
      <li><strong>
         1909 </strong>- After working at the patent office and writing his theories, Einstein got a job teaching theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.
</li>
      <li><strong>
         1911 </strong>- He was given an invitation to the first-ever world physics conference. He was the youngest physicist there.
</li>
      <li><strong>
         1913 </strong>- He believed science's understanding of gravity was wrong, and he worked on a new theory which he would later test with a solar eclipse.
</li>
      <li><strong>
         1919 </strong>- After publishing his Theory of Relativity and correctly predicting the effects of a solar eclipse, Einstein's name went around the world.
</li>
      <li><strong>
         1922 </strong>- Einstein was awarded his first Nobel Prize. He was on his way to Japan when he got the news.

</li>
      <li><strong>
         1945 </strong>- World War II ended and Einstein continued his research. He made advances in heat, gravity, and relativity, and he published over 300 scientific reports.
</li>
      <li><strong>
         1955</strong> - Albert Einstein died in April of heart failure.
</li>
